### How to upgrade

##### djangocms-bootstrap4
- update/remove `settings.DJANGOCMS_BOOTSTRAP4_GRID_CONTAINER_FIELDSETS` if you used it
- rename `settings.DJANGOCMS_BOOTSTRAP4_GRID_CONTAINER_SPACING` to `settings.DJANGOCMS_BOOTSTRAP4_GRID_CONTAINER_VERTICAL_SPACING_EXTERNAL`, consider adding `settings.DJANGOCMS_BOOTSTRAP4_GRID_CONTAINER_VERTICAL_SPACING_EXTERNAL`
- review the bootstrap4 container plugin interface to confirm that the new fields look as you expect them to
- if you used bootstrap4 container plugin `width_external` field - add migrations that drop it, it is no longer useful

##### djangocms-link-all
- add `settings.LINK_ALL_PLUGINS` variable in accordance with `link_all.settings.LINK_ALL_PLUGINS` format, otherwise you won't have `cms.Page` protection

#### Breaking Changes

- moved out `backend.tests.test_pages` into djangocms-helpers 2.2
- moved `backend.plugins.default` to `backend.plugins` for simplification
- deleted `bs4_card_columns`, because it appears that it requires styles and we've haven't seen a request from the client to style it
